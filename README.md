# OpenYeller
OpenYeller is an open source project created as an example for a serie of articles about Microservices architecture using Swagger, Node.js and Docker.

This is a WebApplication that allows users to send geolocated micro messages (aka Yells).
The project is based on a full stack Javascript. The articles explain how to write the code, the unit tests, build the containers and finally, how to deploy on Digital Ocean.
